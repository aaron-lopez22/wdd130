      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose for this website is to provide information on the capability of graphics cards on the market. Graphics cards can be used for a variety of things such as, games, video editing, machine learning, and block chains. There are a wide variety of graphics 
        Cards and the capability of them can vary greatly. While somoneone may want the most powerful someone else may just want the bare minimum to complete their task. This site will provider information to aid in choosing a card. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>MAIN PURPOSE OF THE SITE</p>
      <p>While for most people using computers and machines an integrated graphic card will be sufficient. This site will be for dedicated graphics cards and explain what they are. Dedicated graphics cards come from different manufactures, have different specs, and cost. This site is meant to provide the different manufactures then break it down from there to provide the specs for each card in an easy way to visualize and get the information needed.        
      </p>
      <p>While there are other sites out there a lot of their focus is on other information or selling products. This will be an easy go to website strictly for dedicated graphics cards. You will be able to click on AMD or NVIDIA and see each break down of the card. With the breakdown of the card what will be included is how much dedicated ram will it have. How much will the card cost. What kind of performance can you expect from the card.        
      </p>
      <p>Graphics cards also come with other requirements for them to run. This site will also include what kind of power will they need. What kind of space will the need since graphics cards can run very hot because of the cores so some will need extra fans to keep them cool. There is also what kind of CPU needs to match up with the card.

      <h3>FAQS</h3>
      <p>
        What is a graphics Card?
      </p>
      <p>A graphics card is built with its own processing power meaning it can dedicate itself to do the heavy lifting. There is a gpu inside graphics cards that has cores inside. 
         Cores are thought up as mini calculators all going off within the gpu. Whie integrated cards have cores, 
         they have less cores and their cores are dedicated more towards logic and single tasks whereas gpu wil contain hundreds of more cores dedicated more towards thousands of tasks.
      </p>
      <p>Inside of graphics cards are what we call vram. Ram is used to transmit data to a computer. The computer can have ram but graphics cards have dedicated ram inside of them. These rams retain memory or data. 
         This data is easier accessed and transferred to the screen. Graphics cards all have different ram sizes and this can make a difference in what you are doing with your system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What is a graphics card good for?
      </p>
      <p>
        Graphics cards are good for many reasons some reasons can be gaming, 3d rendering, video encoding, and bitcoin mining. These tasks require lots of mini tasks going on at once. That's where a dedicated graphics card will come in to perform all these tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main manufactures of Graphics cards the two main ones are AMD and NVIDIA.
        These two will have other companies selling their cards with minor differences in them but the specs and naming conventions will come from these two companies. Performance on there card can be similar but cost can vary.

      <h3>Graphics Cards</h3>
      <p>
        AMD GRAPHICS CARDS
      </p>
      <p>
        Amd graphics cards start with the naming convention of AMD Radeon. While NVIDIA can have a slightly higher performance AMD can come at a better price. 
        AMD is known for making updates that can work across the board and be available even on NVIDIA chips. NVIDIA on the other hand can make updates that are mostly geared toward their own graphics cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        NVIDIA GRAPHICS CARDS
      </p>
      <p>
        Nvidia naming convention go by series. Nvidia has the GTX line which was then transitions to RTX. The RTX is based off of a new technology known as ray tracing. 
        Ray tracing technology is about making shading and lighting real time to make for a more immersive experience. The rtx is also for what is known as tensor cores which provide more ai tools.
