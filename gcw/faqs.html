            <h1>What is a graphics Card?</h1>
            <p>A graphics card is built with its own processing power meaning it can dedicate itself to do the heavy lifting. There is a gpu inside graphics cards that has cores inside. Cores are thought up as mini calculators all going off within the gpu. Whie integrated cards have cores, they have less cores and their cores are dedicated more towards logic and single tasks whereas gpu wil contain hundreds of more cores dedicated more towards thousands of tasks.</p>
            <p>Inside of graphics cards are what we call vram. Ram is used to transmit data to a computer. The computer can have ram but graphics cards have dedicated ram inside of them. These rams retain memory or data. This data is easier accessed and transferred to the screen. Graphics cards all have different ram sizes and this can make a difference in what you are doing with your system.</p>

            <p>There are two main manufactures of Graphics cards the two main ones are AMD and NVIDIA. These two will have other companies selling their cards with minor differences in them but the specs and naming conventions will come from these two companies. Performance on there card can be similar but cost can vary.</p>
